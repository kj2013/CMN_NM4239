Using R for Data Journalism
This material explores how to use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in R to collect data and build a story out of it for a data journalism project, with attention to the functions used to access and process the data with a walk-through of the code. Through a case study, this lecture will show how to collect, process and create a basic visualization of the data, with links to more resources and ideas.
